# hw-reminder
Our goal for this project was to create a program which could take new hw assignments and send a hw message to our phone. 
We wanted to delay the time between emails and messages which is why we created this code. 
This code was retrieved from Yan Wang's original IFTT delayer and editted by me to create multiple delays. 
This code is specifically used to trigger an IFTTT messenger applet with a url.
